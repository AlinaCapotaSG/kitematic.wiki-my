As Kitematic is going through the different Beta revisions, many bug fixes have been pushed along with requests for features.

This page will allow you to take ownership of a certain feature and allow other people to join in on the effort to help move things forward. 

### Current roadmap: 
_(from **compatibility** label)_
* Re-factor the code to be Flux compatible `{maintainer: [@JeffDM], contributor: [@Tecknix]}`
* Cleanup legacy code
* Fix issues
* Add features

### Known issues: 
_(from **bug** label)_
* _tbd_

### Future list: 
_(from **feature**/**enhancement** label)_
* Add better error/notification support
* Add support for volumes-from
* Add support for other drivers (not just VM)

If an item is not on the roadmap/future list and a PR is made it will more than likely be shelved. 
This allows the community to know what is actively being worked on and what will be coming. 


_Ownership notation_
* Add your name to an existing list within the contributor/reviewer array [ ]
* A maintainer will claim ownership of the task to provide guidance throughout the implementation
